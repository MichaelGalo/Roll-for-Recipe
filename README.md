# Roll-for-Recipe

## Problem Solved

My wife loves to cook and try new recipes; however, she really dislikes having to choose a menu each week before going to the grocery store and writing down all of her ingredient-needs. I want to create a repository for all her recipes to be stored, updated and/or deleted while giving her the opportunity to randomize our menu for the week.

Roll-for-Recipe will allow a user to create, read, update and delete recipes while also giving the functionality to pick however many recipes a user thinks they'll need to cook that week. It will take from your saved recipes and generate random options to thumb through. In addition (with stretch goals) it will automatically create a shopping list that can be utilized while grocery shopping.

My aim is for this app to fix the time-gap between deciding on what to shop for and actually going to the grocery store with a dedicated list. It's created to give back some free time to busy people who like to cook and shop strategically.
